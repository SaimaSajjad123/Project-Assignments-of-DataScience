Flower Recognition :

Step 1:
Import the libraries:
    • OS Libraray
    • Shutil
    • Matplotlip .pyplot
    • numpy library

Step 2:
    1. Store all folder in one folder name ’Prepared’ for combining all flowers in one folder

Step 3:
Create the directories of train and test of following  flowers:
    • daisy
    • dandelion
    • rose
    • sunflower
    • tulip

Step 4:
Plot one graph in which all directories flowers show

Step 5:
Import the layers and models from the keras
Show model summary

Step 6:
Compile the model
Data Pre-processing

Step 7:
Fit the model and start Epochs
Save the model with ‘.h5’ extension

Step 8:
Plot the accuracy Plot

Step 9:
Apply Prediction for flower.
