Mnist(1):
Step1:
Import the libraries from keras
Step2:
Load the data from the dataset
Step3:
Designing the network:
    • Model the network
    • compile the network
Step4:
Reshape the images(train and test)
Step5:
Generates the epochs and save the  epochs with ‘.h5’ extension.
Step6:
Predict the  from the model and show the result.

Step3:
Model the summary
Step4:
Save the model with ‘.h5’ extension
Step5:
Test the accuracy and loss function
Step6:
Predict the model and show the result
